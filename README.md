# Reddit BBCode

It's a userscript that lets you generate Something Awful BBCode from Reddit posts for easy quoting. Just install via [this](https://github.com/cpancake/reddit-bbcode/raw/master/reddit-bbcode.user.js) link (which just links to reddit-bbcode.user.js) and you'll see a bbcode option appear at the bottom of comments and self posts. Click it and BBCode will be generated and shown to you. Only works with Something Awful BBCode. If you want to use another forum's BBCode, you can do it yourself.
